## Selection of project methodology
### Methodology (or combination) selected

Choosing an Agile methodology for this project will be essential given the business criteria identified in the next 
section. In particular, we will focus on the Scrum Methodology as it will equip the team with a rigorous but flexible 
process applicable for data science. This will be important, because not only, we are looking to develop a web 
application, but we also want to provide exploratory data insights in the form of visualizations and reports.


### Selection criteria and justification of selection
The Scrum Methodology has been selected evaluating the following 5 criteria: Requirements Understanding, Team Location, 
Ease of access to the client, Working Experience with the team and the Scrum Methodology and the Expected Lifetime of 
the product. These 5 criteria have been identified as the most important because they take into consideration any 
the current ability and skills to deploy the web app, original knowledge of dataset, potential risks and blockers
affecting the quality of the work. 

The first criteria considered was the understanding of the requirements ,referring to both their volatility and
complexity. Selecting a flexible methodology, in this regard,  was crucial because we expect  the deliverables to 
vary depending on the business problem and the key findings in the dataset. In other words, remaining flexible 
throughout the whole product development will allow us to be more relevant to the problem, better adapting to the 
customer and the requirements. Scrum can really help in this scenario because it expects the team to plan flexibly with 
sprint plans. This is where all the backlog items will be explained and programmed with an actionable sprint plan. 
Moreover, the Scrum Methodology, not only has a good integration with data science, it 
also allows to specifically and sufficiently meet the deliverables of this project. This is because Scrum is centered 
around working increment of the software. As a result this is the ideal agile data science method for data explorations,
insights and visualisation because we can answer data science questions without having to invest unnecessary time and 
resources that more structured data science methodologies (i.e. DSTP) would require in the modelling phase 
(i.e. Advanced Data Analytics ). With Scrum, this means that while being flexible to uncertain requirements, 
we can still meet the criteria within the scope of Data Science (with visualisation and exploratory data analysis), 
reducing costs that would come from more complex and structured data science processes.

Secondly, the expected lifetime of the web application was an important criterion in selecting the Agile 
Methodology for this project. The main assumption is that the web application will be developed for a specific purpose
where data visualization will help the client answer questions on their business. As the data is static and will not 
change, we are not expecting the web app to last years and it should, therefore, be developed in a fixed timeframe with 
a pre-determined set of resources. The Agile methodology would be very useful in this scenario because it is an 
efficient method to deliver quality work in a scheduled time. This is mainly due to the nature of sprints that allow 
the team to break down the product development in mini projects each with a fixed duration of one month.
The Agile process is well-suited for this situation because we can flexibly change our requirements over the whole 
lifecycle, but it still allows us to deliver incremental results in a fixed time.

Moreover, another important criterion was determining any risks that could block member of the teams working together. 
Working remotely as international students from all over the world with limited team and work experience could be a 
challenge to the client's rapidly changing requirements. With these risks in mind, the Agile methodology offers the best 
balance between working independently while ensuring a regular work cadence. Not only this ensures that all members 
can accomplish objectives autonomously, but it also guarantees that all members share their updates constantly with 
the team. This is achieved through the daily scrums or stand-ups where all the members are asked to 
share their progress and future plans. Moreover, the three pillars upon which the Agile methodology is built 
best address remote workers. Transparency, inspection and adaption pose emphasis keeping each other 
accountable for anomalies and change. This is very important to our project because regardless of the location, everyone
is responsible for the progress and can rapidly adapt to change.

Finally, it was important to consider the level of experience the team had working together and with the Scrum 
Methodology. As a group of students with limited work and methodology experience, it was important to consider a method
that not only that would ease collaboration, but would elicit quick feedback, support and transparency. Within the team,
the Scrum Method offers many learning and feedback opportunities. At the end of each sprint and throughout 
the whole product development, the team can review the incremental product with the customer to elicit feedback. 
This would allow an inexperienced team in the software industry to quickly re-address customers needs. 
Moreover, there is also an opportunity to share feedback internally in the team with sprint retrospectives where the 
team can reflect on areas of improvement. Finally, as Scrum is a well-known industry and the most popular agile 
methodology, support and documentation are widely available. Together with ongoing feedback, they make Scrum ideal for 
entry-level professionals.
